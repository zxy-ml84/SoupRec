Response to Review 3: 

Thanks for your positive feedback and support. 

We have now released an anonymised  GitHub link with all required source code and scripts to deploy our approach (see the beginning of the rebuttal response, this was always our intention to facilitate reproducibility).

Because of the short paper format, we have indeed focused on supporting our main claims within the allowed limited space. Paper length constraints permitting, we will add a short summary of the limitations of our approach at the end of the paper. We will also give the paper a further proofread to iron out any unclarity.
